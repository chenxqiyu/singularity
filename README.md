# Singularity

Singularity is an AIO pancake (ionstack port) root app for Meta VR headsets.

This supports Quest 2, pro, 3, and 3s currently. The process can take a bit to achieve root access. If you are having issues with it failing. Please power the device off and on and try again.

## Usage
1. Install the app with ADB with the command `adb install -g Singularity.apk`
2. Setup Wireless ADB
3. Press Root Now (If it stops and Root Now is no longer greyed out, press it again)
4. Once you gain root, it will soft reboot. Don't try to root again.
5. Check If an app called Singularity-Magisk is in Unknown Sources
6. If it is, open it and grant Singularity root in the Super User tab and close/reopen Singularity
